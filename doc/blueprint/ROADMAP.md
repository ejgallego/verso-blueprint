# Blueprint Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-11

This document tracks the active cleanup and refactor plan for Blueprint support
in this repository.

Background and design rationale live in `DESIGN_RATIONALE.md`.

## Current Priority

1. Keep one source of truth for Blueprint semantics and status derivation.
2. Keep command/traversal render paths aligned with shared `Lib` APIs.
3. Add regression coverage before any new structural split.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Introduce `buildCodeRenderData` so `Informal/Code.lean` stays pure over
   precomputed facts.
2. Fix the highest-priority review issues:
   - nested and duplicate block soft-fail behavior within one module
   - imported duplicate-label collision handling across aggregated files
   - duplicated preview-source representations

## Scheduled Hardening Passes

### Duplicate Identity Hardening

Goal: make duplicate Blueprint identities fail clearly instead of being accepted
locally or silently overwritten during imported-state aggregation.

Implementation scope:

1. Reject invalid nested and duplicate block declarations before they mutate the
   active environment stack.
2. Make `Data.register` and the block elaboration path agree on whether a
   declaration was accepted, ignored, or rejected.
3. Detect imported collisions in `Informal.Environment.informalExt.addImportedFn`
   instead of silently letting later inserts overwrite earlier ones.
4. Apply the same duplicate-collision policy to:
   - node labels
   - group labels
   - author ids

Planned tests:

1. Same-module duplicate label cases in `Tests.BlueprintInformal`.
2. Nested invalid block cases in `Tests.BlueprintInformal`.
3. Cross-module duplicate node labels via sibling provider modules plus one
   importing test module.
4. Cross-module duplicate groups and duplicate authors via the same pattern.
5. Transitive-import coverage so a reexport path does not bypass collision
   detection.
6. Assertions that failures are reported explicitly rather than resolved by
   silent overwrite.

## Planned Work

### Phase 1: Shared Status Semantics

1. Define a shared status record derived from `Data.Node` plus external
   declaration checks.
2. Route graph, summary, and local block status badges through that record.
3. Remove remaining duplicated status recomputation.

### Phase 2: Preview API Consolidation

1. Keep `PreviewSource` as the only preview retrieval abstraction.
2. Audit call sites for direct preview decoding and replace them with shared
   APIs.
3. Keep traversal/widget adapters separate internally, but behind the same
   interface.

### Phase 3: Validation and Safety Nets

1. Add targeted regression tests for:
   - graph hover previews
   - summary hover previews
   - bibliography citations/backrefs
   - widget statement preview rendering
2. Run `./generate-example-blueprints.sh` after each boundary change.
3. Keep behavior-preserving changes until the regression surface is covered.

## UI and Summary Follow-ups

1. Hide zero-value summary cards and sections by default.
2. Collapse duplicate blocker lists into one filtered blockers section.
3. Prefer one primary theorem list by default instead of parallel repeated
   views.
4. Use compact status chips where possible.
5. Consider a compact-mode toggle once the semantics are stable.
6. Revisit the graph page with a CSS-first layout architecture:
   - current graph width placement is mostly CSS-owned, but vertical sizing still
     uses runtime JS because it depends on viewport position, trailing flow
     content, and preserving user-driven canvas resizing across variant switches
   - a future pure-CSS design would likely need a dedicated page/grid layout for
     graph title, controls, legend, canvas, and footer/navigation so the canvas
     height can be expressed declaratively instead of computed after render

## Known Risks

1. Silent divergence between local and global status rendering.
2. Preview regressions not caught by compile-only checks.
3. Silent imported duplicate collisions for labels, groups, or authors unless
   the aggregation pass is hardened.
4. Drift across long-lived worktrees and branches.

## Validation Baseline

1. `lake build VersoBlueprint` passed on the last dedicated refactor pass.
2. `./generate-example-blueprints.sh` passed with warnings only.
3. `python3 test-projects/Noperthedron/check_blueprint_code_panels.py` had a
   known baseline failure at the time of the earlier refactor note:
   - missing `bp_external_status_sorry` in `The-Local-Theorem`
